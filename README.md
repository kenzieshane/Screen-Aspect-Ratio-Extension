# Screen-Aspect-Ratio-Extension
A scratch/turbowarp extension for detecting client's device screen aspect ratio.

Also contains a detector for screen orientation. Very useful for adapting your project's layout to several device if you haven't before. If you don't want to do it the proper way. Also great for debugging purposes.

Best part: no need to install other extension anymore after installing this (for the purpose intended in this extension), i guess.

What makes this extension better than other extensions? Good question. Please leave :D

FOR SCRATCH:
## How to Load:
1. Download the .js file that suits your needs. (available at the release page)
2. In Scratch, use "Load Experimental Extension"
3. Select the file

## Important Notes:
- Multi-monitor features require Chrome/Edge 98+ or Firefox 103+
- The browser may prompt for permission to access screen details
- On older browsers, it will gracefully fall back to primary display only
